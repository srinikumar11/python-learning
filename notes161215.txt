 Srini could you add documentation to explain the steps to set up a completely new project?

Is there a skeleton database/project?
Composer config?
Any other steps?

If you could provide a full rundown that would be great

DO any templates need to be setup? Or will it inherit them from the bundle?
What needs to be configured with for the atdw API?
A list of the available addon bundles that can be enabled and how to do so
Could you talk me through the steps to recreate the melbourne now homepage in the Goulburn River Valley staging environment, also if we wanted to override the 'hero' block template how would we do so?

Hi Fiona,
This is due to the communication gap. As mentioned in our meeting, MRT and VB/BRT has different versions of project. If you are needing a details documentation, Providing list of details that you are expecting would help me in preparing document. I understand that it takes more time on communicating internally back and forth, due to the expectation mismatch. I am trying to provide as much as details form what I know. Please let me know if you are having specific expectations in documentation. 

Let me share a document for VB TXA Integration status. Please let me know your thoughts.

Hi Srini

- https://app.asana.com/0/66590141839516/66590141839526 this document needs to be fleshed out in a lot more detail, with enough information that we can use it to map out exactly what needs to be done (for example, 'File & folder structure changed to adopt global styles' needs to have more information about while files/folders and what changes are required)

basically, we need to be planning out the work in a lot more detail and being clear about what is being done, why, and the potential impacts of those changes.  This to ensure that we're clear on what is being done, the client can be assured about what is being done and make decisions about whether to proceed, we can advise the client how long something will take to do, and reduce risk
We need that same level of detail for this task: https://app.asana.com/0/66590141839516/66590141839528
and this task https://app.asana.com/0/66590141839513/66945767489428
